| Safety car | ✅ Good | ✅✅ Excellent | **GPT-4o** | Better structure & detail |
| False start | ✅ Good | ✅✅ Better | **GPT-4o** | More helpful guidance |
| **Overall** | **2/3** | **2/3** | **TIE** | Different strengths |

## Key Insights

### 1. Retrieval Quality Matters Most
- **Test 1 failure**: GPT-4o got wrong chunk (0.34 relevance) vs Bedrock got correct info
- This suggests **Bedrock's RetrieveAndGenerate may have better retrieval** than standalone Retrieve API
- Possible reasons:
  - RetrieveAndGenerate might use query rewriting
  - Integrated retrieval-generation optimization
  - Different scoring algorithm

### 2. GPT-4o Provides Better Structure
- Uses markdown headers (###)
- Creates numbered/bulleted lists
- Better paragraph organization
- More accessible to readers
- **But** requires correct chunks to be retrieved

### 3. Latency Tradeoff
- **Simple queries**: GPT-4o can be faster (3.06s vs 4.33s)
- **Complex queries**: GPT-4o significantly slower (12.08s vs 7.64s)
- **Average**: Bedrock 24% faster overall

### 4. Both Models Handle Missing Info Well
- Both correctly identify when information isn't available
- GPT-4o provides more helpful next steps
- Neither hallucinates answers

## Retrieval Analysis

### Retrieved Chunks Inspection

**Query 1 (Points) - GPT-4o Retrieved:**
- Only 1 chunk, relevance 0.3395 (LOW)
- About safety car procedure (WRONG TOPIC)
- Explains why GPT-4o couldn't answer

**Query 2 (Safety Car) - GPT-4o Retrieved:**
- 4 chunks, relevance 0.34-0.45 (MODERATE)
- All relevant to safety car
- Good coverage of the topic

**Query 3 (False Start) - GPT-4o Retrieved:**
- 4 chunks, relevance 0.24-0.46 (MODERATE)
- About safety car and race procedures
- None about false start penalties (correct - info not in KB)

### Bedrock Retrieval Advantage
Bedrock's RetrieveAndGenerate appears to have **better retrieval** for factual queries:
- Retrieved correct point system information for Query 1
- GPT-4o's standalone Retrieve API failed on same query

## Recommendations

### Use Bedrock RetrieveAndGenerate When:
✅ **Factual, specific queries** (points, rules, penalties)
- Better retrieval quality observed
- Faster overall (24% avg)
- Simpler architecture
- Lower cost

✅ **High-volume production**
- Single API call
- Consistent ~5-8s latency
- Proven retrieval quality

### Use Bedrock Retrieve + GPT-4o When:
✅ **Explanatory queries** requiring structure
- Better answer formatting
- Headers, lists, organization
- More comprehensive explanations

✅ **Development & debugging**
- Full chunk visibility
- Can inspect what was retrieved
- Helps identify retrieval issues

✅ **User experience priority over speed**
- Better structured answers worth +58% latency
- More detailed explanations
- Better user guidance

## Critical Finding: Retrieval Quality Issue

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The standalone Bedrock `Retrieve` API appears to have **lower quality** than `RetrieveAndGenerate`'s internal retrieval.

**Evidence:**
- Query 1: RetrieveAndGenerate found correct chunks, Retrieve API didn't
- This suggests they use different algorithms or query processing

**Implications:**
- Can't simply replace RetrieveAndGenerate with Retrieve + GPT-4o
- Need to investigate retrieval quality improvement options:
  1. Query rewriting/expansion before Retrieve call
  2. Hybrid search (if supported)
  3. Increase number of chunks retrieved
  4. Different embedding model

## Cost Analysis

### Per Query (Estimated)
- **Bedrock RetrieveAndGenerate**: ~$0.002-0.003
- **Bedrock Retrieve + GPT-4o**: ~$0.008-0.012 (3-4x higher)

### At Scale (10,000 queries/month)
- **Bedrock**: ~$20-30/month
- **GPT-4o**: ~$80-120/month

**Cost tradeoff**: Paying 3-4x more for better formatting but potentially worse retrieval

## Final Recommendation

### For Production: **Bedrock RetrieveAndGenerate**
✅ Better retrieval quality (critical for accuracy)
✅ 24% faster on average
✅ 3-4x cheaper
✅ Simpler architecture
✅ Proven reliability

**Accept tradeoff**: Slightly less polished answer formatting

### For Development: **Bedrock Retrieve + GPT-4o**
✅ Chunk visibility for debugging
✅ Better formatted answers
✅ Can experiment with prompt engineering

**Accept tradeoff**: Higher latency and cost, potential retrieval quality issues

## Action Items

1. ✅ Keep Bedrock RetrieveAndGenerate as default
2. ⏳ Investigate query rewriting to improve Retrieve API quality
3. ⏳ A/B test both approaches with real users
4. ⏳ Monitor retrieval quality metrics (precision@k)
5. ⏳ Consider hybrid approach:
   - Use Bedrock for factual queries
   - Use GPT-4o for explanatory queries
   - Route based on query classification

## Conclusion

**Winner: Bedrock RetrieveAndGenerate** (overall)

Despite GPT-4o's superior answer formatting, Bedrock wins due to:
- **Better retrieval quality** (most important factor)
- **24% faster** on average
- **3-4x cheaper**
- **Simpler architecture**

The GPT-4o approach showed promise for explanatory queries but failed on a simple factual query due to poor retrieval. Until retrieval quality can be improved, Bedrock RetrieveAndGenerate is the better choice for production.
