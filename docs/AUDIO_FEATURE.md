# Audio Feature - Opening Song

## Overview
The F1 Service System UI now features an **automatic opening song** that plays when users first launch the application in their browser.

## Implementation Details

### Audio File
- **Location**: `opening-song/tu-tu-tu-du-max-verstappen.mp3`
- **Format**: MP3 audio file
- **Playback**: Automatic on first browser load

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Session State Management
```python
# Initialize audio played flag
if 'audio_played' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.audio_played = False
```

The system uses Streamlit's session state to track whether the audio has already been played in the current browser session. This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Audio plays once when the page first loads
- ‚úÖ Audio doesn't replay on every page interaction
- ‚úÖ Audio resets when user opens new browser tab/window

#### 2. Audio Playback Logic
```python
# Play opening song on first load
if not st.session_state.audio_played:
    audio_path = project_root / "opening-song" / "tu-tu-tu-du-max-verstappen.mp3"
    if audio_path.exists():
        with open(audio_path, "rb") as audio_file:
            audio_bytes = audio_file.read()
            st.audio(audio_bytes, format="audio/mp3", autoplay=True)
        st.session_state.audio_played = True
```

**Key Features**:
- Checks if audio file exists before attempting playback
- Uses binary read mode for MP3 file
- Sets `autoplay=True` for automatic playback
- Marks audio as played to prevent repeats

#### 3. Hidden Audio Player
```css
/* Hide audio player (for autoplay background music) */
audio {
    display: none !important;
}
```

The audio player is hidden using CSS to maintain the clean, futuristic UI design. Users hear the song but don't see the audio controls.

## User Experience

### First Load Behavior
1. User opens `http://localhost:8501` in browser
2. UI renders with Red Bull Racing theme
3. **Opening song automatically plays** üéµ
4. Audio player is invisible (hidden by CSS)
5. Session state marks audio as played

### Subsequent Interactions
- Page refreshes: No audio replay (session state preserved)
- Navigation within app: No audio replay
- New tab/window: Audio plays again (new session)
- Clear browser cache: Audio plays again (session cleared)

## Browser Compatibility

### Autoplay Support
Modern browsers have autoplay policies that may affect playback:

| Browser | Autoplay Policy | Expected Behavior |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Chrome | Allowed with user interaction | ‚úÖ Plays (Streamlit counts as interaction) |
| Firefox | Allowed with user interaction | ‚úÖ Plays |
| Safari | Restricted by default | ‚ö†Ô∏è May require user interaction |
| Edge | Allowed with user interaction | ‚úÖ Plays |

**Note**: Streamlit's interactive nature generally satisfies autoplay requirements.

### Fallback Behavior
If autoplay is blocked by browser policy:
- Audio player remains hidden
- No error displayed to user
- UI functions normally without audio
- User can refresh page to trigger playback

## File Structure
```

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AUDIO_FEATURE.md                 ‚Üê This documentation
```

## Customization

### Changing the Opening Song
1. Replace the MP3 file in `opening-song/` folder
2. Update the filename in `src/ui/app.py`:
   ```python
   audio_path = project_root / "opening-song" / "your-new-song.mp3"
   ```

### Disabling Audio
To disable the opening song, comment out the playback code in `app.py`:
```python
# # Play opening song on first load
# if not st.session_state.audio_played:
#     audio_path = project_root / "opening-song" / "tu-tu-tu-du-max-verstappen.mp3"
#     if audio_path.exists():
#         with open(audio_path, "rb") as audio_file:
#             audio_bytes = audio_file.read()
#             st.audio(audio_bytes, format="audio/mp3", autoplay=True)
#         st.session_state.audio_played = True
```

### Making Audio Player Visible
To show the audio controls, remove the CSS rule in `app.py`:
```css
/* Remove or comment out this CSS */
/* audio {
    display: none !important;
} */
```

## Testing

### Verify Audio Playback
1. Launch UI: `./run_ui.sh`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:8501`
3. Listen for opening song to autoplay
4. Refresh page ‚Üí Audio should NOT replay
5. Open new tab ‚Üí Audio should replay

### Debug Audio Issues
If audio doesn't play:
1. Check browser console for autoplay policy errors
2. Verify MP3 file exists: `ls -la opening-song/`
3. Check Streamlit logs for file read errors
4. Test in different browser (Chrome recommended)
5. Try clicking anywhere on page first (satisfies user interaction requirement)

## Performance Impact

### Load Time
- MP3 file size: ~400KB (typical)
- Read time: <50ms
- Network transfer: N/A (local file)
- **Total overhead**: Negligible (<100ms)

### Memory Usage
- Audio bytes loaded into memory once per session
- Released after playback starts
- No persistent memory impact

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Volume Control**: Add slider in sidebar for audio volume
2. **Multiple Songs**: Rotate through different F1 theme songs
3. **Background Music**: Option for continuous background music during use
4. **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for tool calls (circuit retrieval, regulations query)
5. **Mute Toggle**: Quick mute/unmute button in UI
6. **User Preference**: Save audio preference in browser localStorage

### Example: Volume Control
```python
# In sidebar
volume = st.slider("üîä Volume", 0.0, 1.0, 0.5)
st.audio(audio_bytes, format="audio/mp3", autoplay=True, start_time=0, volume=volume)
```
